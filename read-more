<p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
created equal.
</p>
  <p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of
that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
field as a final resting-place for those who here gave
their lives that the nation might live. It is altogether
fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a
larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
we cannot hallow, this ground.
